# Microsoft-Access-Database
The group project offers me an opportunity to showcase my understanding and synthesis of the course materials. In this project, I am tasked with designing, building, implementing, and documenting a functional database system using Microsoft Access. The goal is to create a system that supports the activities of a real organization, such as a department within a large business, a recreational organization, or a home-based business. I am encouraged to develop a database system that could potentially be used or enhanced by someone even after the course is completed. The system should be able to store data for five to twelve entities. The project consists of four phases: conceptual data modeling, logical database design, physical database design, and database implementation. In the conceptual data modeling phase, I need to describe the organization or function that will utilize the database system, summarize the information requirements of that function, and create an entity-relationship diagram to depict the conceptual data model. At the end, we had to write an essay and present a Powerpoint to the class.
